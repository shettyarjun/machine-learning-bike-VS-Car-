<p>Welcome to the "Image Processing for Bike and Car Recognition" project! This endeavor is a culmination of our efforts to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to create a robust solution for the classification of images featuring bikes and cars. Our primary objective is to develop an image classification model that can reliably differentiate between these two distinct vehicle types based on visual content. Whether you're interested in understanding the underlying model architecture, learning about the data used in training, running your own image classifications, or contributing to the project's development, this README will guide you through the key aspects of our work. We invite you to explore our project, utilize our codebase, and potentially collaborate with us to enhance the capabilities of this image recognition system. The following sections will provide in-depth insights into the project's prerequisites, installation, data, usage, model architecture, training process, results, and how to contribute. We appreciate your interest and look forward to your involvement in this exciting journey of image processing and machine learning.
