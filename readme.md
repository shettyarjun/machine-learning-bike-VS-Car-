# Image Processing for Bike and Car Recognition

## Overview
<p>
    I embarked on a path into image classification, focusing on distinguishing between bikes and cars. With the aid of YouTube tutorials, I delved into the different libraries used in the project, the mechanics of image classification, training models on labeled datasets, various classification methodologies, and the concepts of image scaling. This immersive learning experience proved invaluable, laying a foundation for my future endeavors.
    I will try to use this newfound knowledge with insights from cybersecurity. 
    By incorporating elements of machine learning into cybersecurity topics, I aim to contribute towards ensuring the safety and security of the internet. This journey not only broadened my technical skills but also allowed me to address pressing societal concerns.
