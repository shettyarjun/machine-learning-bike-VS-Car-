# Image Processing for Bike and Car Recognition

## Overview
This is a machine learning project that focuses on image processing techniques to recognize and classify images of bikes and cars. The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model capable of distinguishing between bikes and cars from images.

<p>Welcome to the "Image Processing for Bike and Car Recognition" project! This endeavor is a culmination of our efforts to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to create a robust solution for the classification of images featuring bikes and cars. Our primary objective is to develop an image classification model that can reliably differentiate between these two distinct vehicle types based on visual content.
