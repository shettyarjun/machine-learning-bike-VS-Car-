<p>Welcome to the "Image Processing for Bike and Car Recognition" project! This endeavor is a culmination of our efforts to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to create a robust solution for the classification of images featuring bikes and cars. Our primary objective is to develop an image classification model that can reliably differentiate between these two distinct vehicle types based on visual content.

    I embarked on a path into image classification, focusing on distinguishing between bikes and cars. With the aid of YouTube tutorials, I delved into the different libraries used in the project, the mechanics of image classification, training models on labeled datasets, various classification methodologies, and the concepts of image scaling. This immersive learning experience proved invaluable, laying a foundation for my future endeavors.
    I will try to use this newfound knowledge with insights from cybersecurity. 
    By incorporating elements of machine learning into cybersecurity topics, I aim to contribute towards ensuring the safety and security of the internet. This journey not only broadened my technical skills but also allowed me to address pressing societal concerns.
